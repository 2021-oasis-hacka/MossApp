The current version was created using C# 4.7.2 and includes the Visual Studio 2017 solution folder. 

This is version 2.0 and includes a better UI, error handling, and various quality of life fixes (saving id and options to user settings, information on requesting a MOSS ID, etc.)

I have published the solution to create the installer. It is located in \MossApp\MossApp\Publish

If you find any errors, please let me know: smay1@nwacc.edu

Thank you.
